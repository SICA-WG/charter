# Standard Crypto API

This project is aimed at defining the charter for the proposed working group.

# Note Well

Following IETF policy about contributions, we want this work to be unencumbered by issues related to
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). In particular (quoted from IETF website), this means that IETF
Contribution: any submission to the StandardCryptoAPI intended by the Contributor for publication as
all or part of produced work and any statement made within the context of an this Workign Group activity.
Such statements include oral statements in meeting sessions, as well as written and electronic communications
made at any time or place.

# Planned Work

This Working Group is aimed at solving a very frustrating issue related to portability of applications
that make use of cryptography. Although lots of work has been dedicated to standardize cryptographic
algorithms in order to provide interoperability (e.g., for secrecy of communication or authentication),
no success has ever been achieved in defining a portable API for applications in this space.
